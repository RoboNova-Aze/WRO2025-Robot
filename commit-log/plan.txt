 RoboNova Commit Log

This folder explains the story of how we -Team RoboNova built our WRO 2025 Future Engineers robot step by step.  
Instead of just code commits, this log captures our progress, challenges, and key milestones.


Week 1~2 – Getting Started
We set up the GitHub repository and created the first structure for our project.  
At this stage, our focus was on understanding the requirements of the competition and deciding what hardware and software setup would suit us best.  
We also tested the L298N motor driver with the Arduino Nano to make sure the motors could be controlled reliably.



Week 3 – Power Decisions
We worked on the power system and agreed on a **dual supply setup**:  
Battery pack for motors, Arduino, and servo.  
Powerbank for Raspberry Pi.  
This choice was made after experimenting and realising that separating power sources would make the Pi more stable.  
We also connected the servo to the buck converter and confirmed that it worked smoothly.



Week 4~5 – First Motor Control
This was an exciting and anxious week because we saw the robot’s wheels move for the first time.  
We wrote the first Arduino sketches to control the motors with PWM.  
The robot could already drive forward, backward. But we had problems with servo motorZ  
We spent time adjusting the pin mapping so that movement matched our chassis setup.


Week 5~6 - Bringing in the Raspberry Pi
We connected the Raspberry Pi with the USB camera and established serial communication with the Arduino.  
This was a big step: now the Pi connect with the Nano.  
For the first time, we managed a complete cycle.
This showed us that the two-layer control idea really works.


Week 7 – Circuit Documentation
After testing, we drew and finalised our circuit schematic.  
We carefully wrote down all connections, including pin mapping and power flow, so the design was clear and reproducible.  
This week was about turning our working prototype into something that could be explained to others.


Week 8~9 – Telling Our Story
We started writing documentation for the competition.  
We added the team introduction (Nahid focusing on coding and algorithms, Ulkar on electronics and wiring) and created this commit log.  
Our aim is to show juries not only the final robot, but also the journey of how we built it step by step.


 Next Steps
We will continue adding to this log as we improve our software, test vision algorithms, and fine-tune the robot for competition.  
This way, anyone and also our juries reading our repository can see the full development story of RoboNova.
