Components List and Description
This section describes all the hardware components that we used in the WRO 2025 Future Engineers Robot project, including their specifications and purpose.

1. Raspberry Pi 5 (4 GB RAM)
The Raspberry Pi 5 is the main controller of the robot.
It is a single-board computer with 4 GB RAM, capable of running a full operating system which is Raspberry Pi OS and controlling sensors, motors, and cameras.
It also provides GPIO pins for hardware control and USB, HDMI, and networking ports for expansion.

2. Micro SD Card (4 GB)
The micro SD card stores the operating system and all robot-related programs.
For this project, a 4 GB card is used. It contains: Raspberry Pi OS, motor control code, and sensor processing scripts

3. Yellow DC Gear Motors
These are TT DC Gear Motors  which we commonly call “yellow gear motors”.
They are low-voltage motors with an integrated gearbox, providing higher torque at lower speeds which is ideal for our self-driving robot.

4. Wheels (Black)
Paired with the yellow gear motors, the black plastic wheels provide traction and allow the robot to move smoothly on the competition surface.

5. L298N Motor Driver Module
The L298N dual H-bridge motor driver controls the two yellow DC motors.
It allows the Raspberry Pi to control motor's direction forward and backward. And also we can adjust motor speed by PWM signals.

6. LiPo Batteries (3 × 1S, 3.7V, 1500 mAh)
Three 1S LiPo batteries are used to power the motors and electronics.
Each battery has nominal voltage of 3.7 V and current of 1500 mAh. We connected them in series which will give us nominal voltage of 11.1 V and current of 1500 mAh. These are connected with a power distribution system to ensure stable voltage for protecting other components.

7.LM2596 2A DC-DC Converter
The DC-DC step-down converter regulates voltage from the LiPo batteries to the required level for the Raspberry Pi and servo motor.

8. Raspberry Pi Camera
The Raspberry Pi Camera module provides real-time vision to the robot for object detection and detecting colours.

9. MG90 Servo Motor
The servo motor is used for precise rotational movement for 2 front wheels. It can rotate to a specific angle based on control signals from 0 degree to 180 degree.

10. IR Sensors (3 ×)
Three Infrared (IR) sensors are used for line tracking and obstacle detection. They work by emitting infrared light and detecting reflections from surfaces which helps us to detect walls.

11. Switch
A physical power switch is included to turn the robot on or off safely, without unplugging wires.
