WRO 2025 – Future Engineers
Team RoboNova (Azerbaijan)

1. Introduction
Team RoboNova is participating in the WRO 2025 Future Engineers category with our project: an autonomous four-wheel robot.  
The goal of this project is to design a mobile platform that can navigate, make decisions, and respond to its environment using a combination of electronics, mechanics, and software.

Our robot is built with widely available, low-cost components such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and standard DC gear motors.  
We focused on building a system that is not only functional but also modular, easy to expand, and stable under real competition conditions.

2. Hardware Architecture
The robot is constructed around the following core components:

- Arduino Nano  
  Used as the low-level controller, it generates PWM signals for motors and the servo.  
  The Arduino ensures precise and real-time actuation of the robot’s movements.

- Raspberry Pi (with USB camera)  
  Acts as the high-level computing unit.  
  It processes visual data from the camera, runs navigation algorithms, and sends commands to the Arduino.  
  The Pi is dedicated to decision-making tasks, while the Arduino focuses on execution.

- L298N Motor Driver  
  Dual H-bridge driver that controls two yellow DC gear motors.  
  Each side of the chassis is driven by one motor, giving the robot differential drive capability (forward, backward, turning).

- Two Yellow DC Gear Motors (4 wheels)  
  Provide the main locomotion of the robot.  
  These motors are efficient and provide enough torque for stable movement.

- Servo Motor  
  Used for steering or controlling an additional mechanism.  
  Controlled directly by the Arduino, it enables smooth directional adjustments.

- Power System  
  The robot uses a dual power approach:  
  • A 7–12 V battery pack supplies the motors (through L298N) and powers the Arduino + servo (through a buck converter).  
  • A 5 V USB powerbank powers the Raspberry Pi and camera.  
  This separation ensures that the Pi is isolated from motor current spikes, keeping computations stable.

3. Power Distribution Overview
- Battery pack (7–12 V):  
  • Directly powers the L298N VIN for motor control.  
  • Feeds into a buck converter that steps down to 5 V, which powers the Arduino Nano and servo motor.  

- Powerbank (5 V USB):  
  • Directly powers the Raspberry Pi and camera via USB.  

- Common Ground:  
  • All components share a common ground to ensure proper communication between Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

4. Software Architecture
The robot follows a layered control system:

- Arduino Nano Software:  
  • Generates PWM signals to control motor speed and direction.  
  • Controls the servo for steering.  
  • Receives high-level commands from the Raspberry Pi over serial communication.  

- Raspberry Pi Software:  
  • Captures and processes camera images.  
  • Runs navigation and decision-making algorithms.  
  • Sends movement commands to Arduino (e.g., “go forward”, “turn left”).

This division allows the robot to remain responsive (thanks to the Arduino) while also being intelligent (thanks to the Pi).

5. Design Choices
We designed the system with the following goals in mind:  
- Stability – separating power supplies prevents the Raspberry Pi from resetting when motors draw high current.  
- Modularity – the Arduino and Raspberry Pi are loosely coupled. Either unit can be modified or upgraded without affecting the other.  
- Accessibility – all parts used are common and easy to replace, making the design reproducible for other teams or students.  
- Expandability – additional sensors or modules can be added to the Arduino or Raspberry Pi with minimal changes.

6. Team RoboNova
- Nahid Mammadov – responsible for software development, coding, and computer vision system.  
- Ulkar Rahimli – responsible for electronics, wiring, and hardware assembly.  

We worked as a balanced team where one member focused on the “brain” (coding and logic) while the other focused on the “body” (electronics and wiring).  
Together, this collaboration made it possible to build a complete working robot.

7. Goals
Our aim with RoboNova is to demonstrate how affordable components and clear design principles can be combined to create a powerful autonomous system.  
Through this project we want to show:  
- How separation of high-level and low-level control improves reliability.  
- How modular electronics design can simplify debugging and upgrades.  
- How robotics can be made accessible without expensive, specialised hardware.  

8. Conclusion
RoboNova is more than just a robot – it is a learning platform and a demonstration of teamwork, design thinking, and practical engineering.  
By combining Arduino for control, Raspberry Pi for intelligence, and a carefully managed dual power supply system, we created a robot that is both capable and robust.  
This architecture positions RoboNova as a strong candidate for the WRO 2025 Future Engineers challenge.
