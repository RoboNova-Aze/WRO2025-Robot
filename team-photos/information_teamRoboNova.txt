 Team RoboNova – WRO 2025 Future Engineers

We are Team RoboNova, proudly representing Azerbaijan in the WRO 2025 Future Engineers category. Our team consists of two passionate young engineers, each bringing a unique set of skills and experiences to the project. Together, we combined software development, electronics expertise, and creative problem-solving to design and build an autonomous robot capable of meeting the challenges of this competition.

Nahid Mammadov – Software and Algorithms

Nahid is the team member responsible for the software side of RoboNova. His main focus areas include:

Writing and testing the Arduino Nano code to ensure smooth motor and servo control.

Developing the Raspberry Pi software that handles computer vision, navigation, and high-level decision-making.

Creating the communication link between the Pi and the Arduino, ensuring that data and commands flow without delays.

Testing different control strategies so that the robot can adapt to changing conditions during the challenge.

Nahid is a 5 th year student from BHOS - Process Automation. 

Ulkar Rahimli – Electronics and Hardware

Ulkar is the team member responsible for the electronics and hardware design of RoboNova. Her contributions include:

Designing and assembling the complete circuit layout of the robot, connecting the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, motors, servo, motor driver, and power systems.

Carefully managing the dual power supply (battery + powerbank) to keep the robot stable and efficient.

Ensuring that the motors and servo are wired correctly and that all components share a common ground for reliable communication.

Testing different hardware setups and making adjustments to achieve the best performance.

Ulkar is a 3 rd year student from BEU-INHA DDP- Electronic Engineering.

Collaboration and Teamwork

What makes RoboNova strong is the way we combine our skills.

Nahid focuses on the “brain” of the robot – the logic, code, and decision-making.

Ulkar focuses on the “body” of the robot – the wiring, power management, and physical connections.

By working side by side, we ensure that the robot’s brain and body are always aligned and connected with each other. When software requires a new signal, Ulkar adjusts the hardware. When the hardware changes, Nahid adapts the code. 

Our project is more than just a robot. It represents our team spirit, creativity, and determination. We believe that robotics should be both accessible and innovative. By using simple, affordable components such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and common DC motors, we show that high performance can be achieved without expensive equipment.

As Team RoboNova, our vision is to demonstrate how young engineers from Azerbaijan can design, build, and present a robot that is not only functional but also inspiring. We want to prove that with teamwork, focus, and dedication, small teams can achieve big goals.
